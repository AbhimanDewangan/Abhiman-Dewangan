     <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Greetings Everyone!!
            My name is  <strong>Abhiman Dewangan </strong> , an upcoming Senior Student in <strong>Indian School Sohar</strong>.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôm a curious and driven student with a deep passion for technology and a growing expertise in programming. Over the years, I‚Äôve built a strong foundation in  <strong>STEM Subjects</strong> and achieved notable success in national and international Olympiads. 
        </p> 
        
        
        
   <p> <strong>Highlights: </strong></p>

<p>       
  Beyond academics, I love challenging myself in diverse ways. Whether it‚Äôs representing my school in basketball tournaments, participating in the <strong>JSKA Karate Championship</strong> in <strong>Muscat</strong>, or earning guitar certifications from <strong>Trinity College London</strong>, I thrive on learning, teamwork, and creativity. </p> <p>These experiences have taught me resilience, collaboration, and the value of pursuing excellence in every endeavor.
            
 On the technical side, I‚Äôm skilled in  <strong>Python</strong> and SQL, and I‚Äôm constantly expanding my knowledge with certifications in programming, cybersecurity, and data science. My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills and experiences to make a meaningful impact in the world of computer science and technology.
            
 I‚Äôm always eager to connect with like-minded individuals to share ideas, explore opportunities, and collaborate on exciting projects. Let‚Äôs grow and innovate together!</p>

     <h2>Projects</h2>
        
<h2>üìÇ <strong>Document Loading with LangChain</strong></h2>
    
<p> I implemented a robust solution to load and process both <strong>txt</strong> and <strong>.pdf</strong> files using <strong>LangChain's TextLoader and PyPDFLoader</strong>. These tools enable seamless extraction of textual data from various file formats, making it easy to handle unstructured data. For example,  <strong>TextLoader</strong> efficiently loads plain text files, while  <strong>PyPDFLoader</strong> handles PDFs, extracting both content and metadata. This setup is perfect for building applications that require ingesting large volumes of documents for further analysis.</p>
    

<h2>üîç <strong>Chunking for Efficiency</strong></h2>
<p>To optimize processing, I used <strong>LangChain‚Äôs RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter</strong>, which breaks down large files into smaller, meaningful chunks. This step ensures that even extensive documents are manageable for downstream tasks like querying or summarization. By customizing parameters like chunk size and overlap, I ensured that the text chunks retain their semantic coherence. This approach is especially useful when working with long-form content such as annual reports or research papers.</p>


<h2>üß† <strong>Vector Embeddings for Intelligent Retrieval</strong></h2>

<p>To enable fast and intelligent knowledge retrieval, I transformed these text chunks into vector embeddings using <strong>OpenAIEmbeddings</strong>. These embeddings allow for semantic search, making it possible to retrieve relevant information based on context rather than exact keywords. For instance, I can now instantly locate <strong>"key findings"</strong> or other critical insights across hundreds of documents with remarkable accuracy. This capability is a game-changer for anyone dealing with large-scale document repositories.

<h2>Experience</h2>

<h2>YOUNGO Descision Making Process Team: Jan 2025-Present</h2>
<p>I align strongly with YOUNGO principles and values by prioritizing inclusivity, collaboration, and meaningful youth engagement in all my actions. I believe in the power of diversity and strive to create spaces where all voices‚Äîregardless of background, nationality, or experience‚Äîare heard and valued. This reflects YOUNGO‚Äôs commitment to inclusivity and equitable representation.

 I also resonate with the principle of <strong>transparency</strong> and <strong>accountability</strong>. I ensure clear communication, open dialogue, and ethical practices in every initiative I take part in. By fostering trust and mutual respect, I contribute to a collaborative environment that aligns with YOUNGO‚Äôs core values.
        
 As a firm advocate for climate justice, I support actions rooted in equity, acknowledging the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities. I emphasize youth empowerment by encouraging  <strong>leadership, capacity building, and amplifying young voices </strong> to influence decision-making processes.
        
Lastly, I align with YOUNGO‚Äôs vision of action-oriented solutions by approaching challenges with creativity and determination. I aim to contribute to tangible outcomes, ensuring youth-led initiatives inspire real change while upholding the principles of sustainability, fairness, and global solidarity. Through these values, I am committed to advancing YOUNGO‚Äôs mission in creating an inclusive, impactful climate movement. As a member of YOUNGO, I took part in January Reforms 2025.</p>


<h2>Student Council: Discipline Prefect: Apr 2023 - Apr 2024</h2>

 <p>As a <strong>School Discipline Prefect</strong>, I played a pivotal role in maintaining discipline and ensuring that the school‚Äôs code of conduct was upheld at all times. My responsibilities included overseeing daily student behavior, resolving conflicts, and ensuring a respectful and orderly environment across the school. I actively participated in the management of various school events, where I worked to ensure that everything proceeded smoothly and according to plan.

One of my key contributions was conducting the <strong>Teachers‚Äô Day Program</strong>, where I managed backstage operations, coordinated with performers, and ensured the event‚Äôs seamless execution. Additionally, I was instrumental during the visit of <strong>Amit Narang</strong>, the<strong> Ambassador of India to Oman</strong>, to our school. I worked diligently to ensure discipline throughout the campus and assisted in maintaining the decorum and high standards expected during such a significant occasion.</p>
